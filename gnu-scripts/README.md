This is a collection of Gnuplot scripts I used during my graduate studies. 
Gnuplot is a coding plotting software that generates [EPS] files that are 
good for editing later in Adobe Illustrator. After graduating I lost access
to my old data and files, but I have provided a few examples here which,
once you understand the syntax of Gnuplot they are easy to follow and can
serve as templates. 

Gnuplot reads one or more data files and makes some plots according to what
you code in. It can create 2D and 3D plots and you can manipulate data as
well, so you can do mathematical operations on a whole column - although I 
never did anything extreme. 

I think it's a cool open source software and you can find more about it here:
