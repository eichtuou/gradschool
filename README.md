Hey there!

This directory contains a series of scripts I developed during my graduate career.
My MS was in Computational Chemistry where I worked specifically with organometallic
dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. I used Gaussian09, VASP, IETsim, and YAeHMOP.
Mpst of the scripts I developed were to help (1) extract data and organize data files,
(2) create lots submission scripts and submit them with one click, (3) translate a file
to another file type, and (4) probably something else I am missing, BUT nothing fancy, 
just scripts that made my life easier.  

After my MS I started working in an experimental Biophysical Chemistry lab with very
little computational work. My scripting got a but rusty, but I still developed some 
small scripts for extracting data and organizing data files. On my fourth year I 
started woring on some molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and some DFT calculations
on dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP) protein - a 'big system' for these kind of 
calculations.

Now (mid 2021) on my on my fifth and last PhD year I decided to organize my Github. I
lost all my files from my MS so I provided dummy calculation files on the molecule of
water, just to show you the capabilities of my scripts. The scripts I developed during
my PhD have the DHP system in them as an example.
