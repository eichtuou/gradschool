Hey there!

This directory contains a series of scripts I developed during my graduate career.
My M.S. was in Computational Chemistry where I worked specifically with organometallic
dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. I used the Gaussian09, VASP, IETsim, and
YAeHMOP softwares. The methodologies I used were Density Functional Theory (DFT),
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), ab initio simulations, and quantum dynamics (QD). Most
of the scripts I developed were to help me (1) extract and analyze data, (2) organize
data files, (3) create input files and submission scripts, (4) translate from a file 
type to another file type, and (5) probably something else I am missing, BUT nothing
fancy, just scripts that made my life easier.  

After my M.S. I started working towards my Ph.D. in an experimental Biophysical
Chemistry lab with very little computational work (at the beginning). My scripting got
a bit rusty, but I still developed some scripts for extracting and analyzing data and 
organizing data files. On my fourth year I started working on some molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and molecular docking calculations on dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP)
protein. For these I used NAMD, CHARMM, and AutoDock Vina. 

On my last Ph.D. year I decided to brush up my GitHub. I lost all my files from my M.S. 
so I provided some dummy calculation files on the water molecule to demonstrate the 
capabilities of my scripts. All the scripts I developed during my Ph.D. are based on the 
DHP system and provide real data examples. All scripts are documented and have docstrings 
that explain what each script does and how to run it. 

I am currently (2023) working on improving all the scripts and updating them to python3.11+

Thanks for reading all that! And if somehow you find these useful and use them in your
publications/reserach you can acknowledge me as: 
    "...thanks to Jessica M. Gonz√°lez-Delgado from the Department of Chemistry at North 
    Carolina State University for her open-source code libraries..."
