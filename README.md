Hey there!

This directory contains a series of scripts I developed during my graduate career.
My M.S. was in Computational Chemistry where I worked specifically with organometallic
dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. I used the Gaussian09, VASP, IETsim, and
YAeHMOP softwares. The methodologies I used were Density Functional Theory (DFT),
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), ab initio simulations, and quantum dynamics (QD). Most
of the scripts I developed were to help me (1) extract and analyze data, (2) organize
data files, (3) create input files and submission scripts, (4) translate from a file 
type to another file type, and (5) probably something else I am missing, BUT nothing
fancy, just scripts that made my life easier.  

After my M.S. I started working towards my Ph.D. in an experimental Biophysical
Chemistry lab with very little computational work (at the beginning). My scripting got
a bit rusty, but I still developed some scripts for extracting and analyzing data and 
organizing data files. On my fourth year I started working on some molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations and molecular docking calculations on dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP)
protein. For these I used NAMD, CHARMM, and AutoDock Vina. 

Now (mid 2021) on my on my fifth and last Ph.D. year I decided to organize my GitHub. I
lost all my files from my M.S. so I provided some dummy calculation files on the water
molecule just to show you the capabilities of my scripts. All the scripts I developed
during my Ph.D. are based on the DHP system and provide real data examples.

Every script has a description inside that explains what the code does and how to run it. 

Thanks for reading all that! And if somehow you find these useful and use them in your
publications/reserach please credit me as: Jessica M. Gonz√°lez-Delgado
