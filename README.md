Hey there!

This directory contains a series of scripts I developed during my graduate career.
My M.Sc. was in Computational Chemistry where I worked specifically with organometallic
dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. I used the Gaussian09, VASP, IETsim, and
YAeHMOP softwares. The methodologies I used were Density Functional Theory (DFT),
time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), ab initio simulations, and quantum dynamics (QD). Most
of the scripts I developed were to help me (1) extract data and organize data files,
(2) create lots of submission scripts and submit them with one click, (3) translate
a file to another file type, and (4) probably something else I am missing, BUT nothing
fancy, just scripts that made my life easier.  

After my M.Sc. I started working towards my Ph.D. in an experimental Biophysical
Chemistry lab with very little computational work. My scripting got a bit rusty, but
I still developed some small scripts for extracting data and organizing data files. On
my fourth year I started woring on some molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and DFT 
and Nudge Elastic Band (NEB) calculations on dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP) protein.
For these I used NAMD, CHARMM, and DMol3.

Now (mid 2021) on my on my fifth and last PhD year I decided to organize my Github. I
lost all my files from my MS so I provided dummy calculation files on the water molecule 
just to show you the capabilities of my scripts. The scripts I developed during my PhD
have the DHP system in them as an example.
